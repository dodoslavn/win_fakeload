# Why
Motherboard on my PC is faulty and my PC keep restarting if there is no workload on CPU.  
So this is my solution to the problem.
# How
You set how many cores should be utilized, and what is the level of load which is considered too low.  
If the CPU usage falls below the threshold it creates the artifical utilization.
